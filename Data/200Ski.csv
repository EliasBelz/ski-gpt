They're crazy light, super nimble, and built to fly up the skin track. They eat kick turns for breakfast, and for lunch they feast on fresh corn snow. But these things are way more than just an uphill tool. After all, why fly up to the top if you can't have as much fun as possible flying back down to the bottom? These slim sticks are made with a sturdy flex, slightly tapered tips, and just a bit of tip rocker, so you can be hooting and hollering the whole way down, after you effortlessly glide the whole way up.",Alpine Touring,Advanced-Expert,Rocker/Camber,Medium,Flat,"Carbon, Metal, Wood",2 Years
